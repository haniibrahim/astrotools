AT_astroconst(),Physical constants,,,AT_astroconst(); earth.mass,Saved as structs. Need to be called once to use the constants
AT_atmosphAdsorbCoeff,Atmosheric adsorption coefficient,"dist  = Visual distance in m
",sigma = Atmosheric adsorption coefficient in m**(-1),AT_atmosphAdsorbCoeff(10.3),
AT_fallvelo,Fall velocity,"h = Height in m
A = Acceleration in m/s² (optional), if not specified a = 9.80665",v = fall velocity in m/s,AT_fallvelo(40000),
AT_gravity,Gravity of a body in a specific height,"m = Mass of the body in kg
r = Radius of the body in m
h = Height above the body in m",,"AT_astroconst(); AT_gravity(earth.mass, earth.r, 400000) // Gravity @ISS",
AT_isCelestlab,Checks if CelestLab toolbox is installed and loaded,,,AT_isCelestlab(),
AT_orbitalspeed,Orbitalspeed in m/s,"m = Mass of the heaviest object in kg
r = distance at which the speed is to be calculated in m
A = length of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit. For the Earth at perihelion in m",v = orbital speed in m/s,"AT_astroconst(); AT_orbitalspeed(earth.mass, 400000, earth.per)",
AT_refraction_add,Atmospheric refraction of an apparent altitude,"h_s: apparent altitude of the astronomical body in °
t:   temperatur in K (OPTIONAL), if not specified t=283K
P:   pressure in hPa (OPTIONAL), if not specified p=1010hPa",R:   Atmospheric refraction correction in °,AT_refraction(25),You have to add the value to a calculated/real altitude to get the the observed altitude
AT_refraction_del,Atmospheric refraction elimination of an observed altitude,"h_o: observed altitude of the astronomical body in °
t:   temperatur in K (OPTIONAL), if not specified t=283K
P:   pressure in hPa (OPTIONAL), if not specified p=1010hPa",Atmospheric refraction in °,AT_refraction_del(25),"You have to substract the value to a observed altitude to get the
 real altitude w/o atmospheric influence."
AT_visualRange,Visual range w/ or w/o terrestrial refraction,"height1 = height of eye/instrument in m
height2 = height of distant object in m
Refr = terrestrial refraction (OPTIONAL), set to 1 (no refraction) if not committed, refr = 1.08 is common value.",range = visual range of sight in m,"AT_visualRange(1.7, 12, 1.08)",Calculate how far you can see w/ or W/o terrestrial refraction correction. Mostly used for terestial views.
