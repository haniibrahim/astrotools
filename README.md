# Astrotools for Scilab
Astronomy functions for [Scilab](http://www.scilab.org/). Based on the [CelestLab](https://atoms.scilab.org/toolboxes/celestlab/)-Toolbox from [CNES](https://cnes.fr/en) (French space agency).

> Just for my own purpose. Still under development. Use it if you find it useful.

## Functions description

Refer [`doc-table.csv`](https://github.com/haniibrahim/scilab-astrotools/blob/master/doc-table.csv "") as a quick reference manual.

## Usage

 * Save the files in an arbitrary directory. 
 * Load all sci-files with `getd('/path/to/sci-files')` 
 * To use the physical and astromical constants type `AT_astroconst()`. E.g. to get the radius of the earth you get it by `earth.r`. Open the file `AT_astroconst.sci` for details.

You have to repeat this procedure after every restart of Scilab. If you want to avoid this, use the [library functionality](https://help.scilab.org/doc/5.3.3/en_US/lib.html "") of Scilab.
